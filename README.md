# GoLang-BiGraph
Go implementation of a bidirectional graph as used in my PhD thesis PoC

Paired down Go package that implements a bidirectional (undirected) graph with the required functionality. It includes methods to:

Load the graph from an adjacency list file.
Check if an edge or vertex is isolated.
Add or remove vertices.
Compute the shortest path between any two vertices using BFS.
Some unit tests.
